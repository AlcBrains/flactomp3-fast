# flactomp3-fast
Automated script that converts all flac files in a folder to mp3

Ever get tired of manually uploading files one by one in some obscure "flac-to-mp3-converter" site, that also looks like it spawns popups until you start crying?

Fear not, friend! This script finds all flac files in a specified folder and converts them to mp3. Its only prerequisite is bash and ffmpeg.

Feel free to fork if you wanna improve it.
